# PSAP_auto_generator
Primary school arithmetic practices auto generator.  
If you are tutoring some primary kids and want to give them practices, this is a easy tool to use.  
Download the PSAP_auto_generator.exe to the folder you want to store the questions, as using it will create a .txt file there.  
Advice: use with MS word for easy printing (i.e. copy whatever in the .txt file to a word document then print)  
The range of each number is 0~99
